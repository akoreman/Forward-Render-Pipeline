# Custom shader pipeline using Unity3D SRP and HLSL

In order to gain more intuition for scripting render pipelines this project implements a custom forward render
pipeline in Unity3D by using its scriptable render pipeline (SRP) and HLSL for the shaders. For some parts following the
tutorial by [CatLikeCoding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/custom-srp/).

**Currently supports:**
- Unlit and Lit shaders
  - Opaque and transparant.
  - Texture sampling.
- Illumination by multiple colored directional lights
  - BRDF controlled by metallic and smoothness parameters.
  - Casted shadows using light maps.
    - Support for cascaded light maps.
    - Support for varying light map resolution.
    - Clipped shadows for transparent objects.
  - Support for soft shadows using PCF.
  - Support for normal maps.
- Global illumination
  - Support for sampling from the lightmaps generated by Unity for static objects.
  - Support for using light probes and LPPVs to approximate GI for dynamic objects.
  - Meta pass for colored GI.
- Specular reflections
  - Support for reflections from the skybox.
  - Support for reflections from unity reflection probes.
  - Reflection sharpness affected by surface rougness.
- Support for emmisive surfaces.
- Support for point lights + shadows.
- Support for spot lights (without shadows).
